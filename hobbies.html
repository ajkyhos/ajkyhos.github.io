  <h3> Things I Enjoy Doing </h3>
  <p> There are many things I enjoy doing and here are some of my top picks: </p>

      <dt>Music</dt>
      <dd>Music has always been a huge part of my life, but I definitly realized my love for it in high school. I started to discover old rock bands, I bought
        my first electric guitar (and performed on stage with it less than a year later), began collecting records and CDs, and making my own tunes. Since I've
        been at Madison, my passion for the art has only grown exponentially. Ever since, I've learned how to play many more instruments, built my own guitar,
        play in the marching band, host my own radio show, and now I book bands to perform at the Wisconsin Unions. A crazy musical journey to say the least.</dd>
