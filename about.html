  My name is <b>Alex Kyhos</b> and I grew up in a small town in the center of Wisconsin. Both of my parents own and operate a local hardware store which
  acted as both a first job and a second home. I was very active in high school with clubs and organizations, leading to lots of opportunity outside the town.
  Since I also loved going to Badger Football games, UW Madison had always been one of my top school choices after graduating. Following graduation, I decided
  to persue a degree in Communication Arts at UW Madison which has opened many doors for potential career paths. My time at Madison has been nothing short of
  extrodinary, as I remain involved in as much as I possibly can. I am an active member of the <i>UW Marching Band</i>, a talent booker and videographer for 
  <i>WUD Music</i>, a graphic designer for the <i>College of Engineering</i>, a sound designer for <i>Badgermation</i>, and an active member of the 
  <i>Hollywood Badgers</i>. Click the <a href="http://akyhos.myportfolio.com/graphic-design">link</a> to see some of my work in video and graphic design!
